This adheres to the expressiveness and effectiveness principles.\n\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(datasets)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = hp, size = factor(cyl), shape = factor(cyl), color = factor(cyl))) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(title = \"Violation of Marks and Channels\",\n       x = \"Miles per Gallon (mpg)\",\n       y = \"Horsepower (hp)\",\n       size = \"Cylinders\",\n       shape = \"Cylinders\",\n       color = \"Cylinders\")\n```\n\n\n**Caption**: Figure 2 uses size, shape, and color to encode the number of cylinders, violating the expressiveness and effectiveness principles. It creates visual clutter and confusion.\n\n\n```{r}\nggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2, fill = \"skyblue\", color = \"white\") +\n  labs(title = \"Proper Discriminability\",\n       x = \"Miles per Gallon (mpg)\",\n       y = \"Count\")\n```\n\n\n**Caption**: Figure 3 uses an appropriate number of bins for the histogram, facilitating discriminability of the mpg attribute.\n\n\n```{r}\nggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5, fill = \"skyblue\", color = \"white\") +\n  labs(title = \"Violation of Discriminability\",\n       x = \"Miles per Gallon (mpg)\",\n       y = \"Count\")\n\n```\n\n\n**Caption**: Figure 4 uses too many bins, violating the guidelines for discriminability and making it difficult to interpret the distribution of mpg.\n\n\n```{r}\nggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = hp, color = factor(cyl), shape = factor(gear))) +\n  geom_point(size = 3) +\n  labs(title = \"Proper Separability\",\n       x = \"Miles per Gallon (mpg)\",\n       y = \"Horsepower (hp)\",\n       color = \"Cylinders\",\n       shape = \"Gears\")\n\n```\n\n\n**Caption**: Figure 5 uses separate color and shape channels to encode the number of cylinders and gears, maintaining separability.\n\n\n```{r}\nggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = hp, fill = factor(cyl), alpha = hp)) +\n  geom_point(size = 5, shape = 21) +\n  labs(title = \"Violation of Separability\",\n       x = \"Miles per Gallon (mpg)\",\n       y = \"Horsepower (hp)\",\n       fill = \"Cylinders\",\n       alpha = \"Horsepower\")\n\n```\n\n\n**Caption**: Figure 6 uses fill color and transparency, which are less separable, to encode the number of cylinders and horsepower, violating the principle of separability.\n\n\n```{r}\nggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = hp)) +\n  geom_point(size = 3, color = \"grey\") +\n  geom_point(data = subset(mtcars, cyl == 4), aes(x = mpg, y = hp), color = \"red\", size = 4) +\n  labs(title = \"Effective Popout\",\n       x = \"Miles per Gallon (mpg)\",\n       y = \"Horsepower (hp)\")\n\n```\n\n\n**Caption**: Figure 7 highlights cars with 4 cylinders in red, effectively using the concept of popout.\n\n\n```{r}\nggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = hp, color = factor(cyl))) +\n  geom_point(size = 3) +\n  labs(title = \"Ineffective Popout\",\n       x = \"Miles per Gallon (mpg)\",\n       y = \"Horsepower (hp)\",\n       color = \"Cylinders\")\n\n```\n\n\n**Caption**: Figure 8 uses color to distinguish all cylinder counts, making it difficult to identify specific points and failing to achieve the popout effect compared to Figure 7.\n\n",
