Expressiveness and Effectiveness

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
data(mtcars)

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = hp, color = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  labs(title = "Proper Use of Marks and Channels",
       x = "Miles per Gallon (mpg)",
       y = "Horsepower (hp)",
       color = "Cylinders")
```

Caption: Figure 1 shows the relationship between miles per gallon (mpg) and horsepower (hp) using color to distinguish between different numbers of cylinders. This adheres to the expressiveness and effectiveness principles.

```{r}
library(datasets)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = hp, size = factor(cyl), shape = factor(cyl), color = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Violation of Marks and Channels",
       x = "Miles per Gallon (mpg)",
       y = "Horsepower (hp)",
       size = "Cylinders",
       shape = "Cylinders",
       color = "Cylinders")
```

**Caption**: Figure 2 uses size, shape, and color to encode the number of cylinders, violating the expressiveness and effectiveness principles. It creates visual clutter and confusion.

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2, fill = "skyblue", color = "white") +
  labs(title = "Proper Discriminability",
       x = "Miles per Gallon (mpg)",
       y = "Count")
```

**Caption**: Figure 3 uses an appropriate number of bins for the histogram, facilitating discriminability of the mpg attribute.

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5, fill = "skyblue", color = "white") +
  labs(title = "Violation of Discriminability",
       x = "Miles per Gallon (mpg)",
       y = "Count")

```

**Caption**: Figure 4 uses too many bins, violating the guidelines for discriminability and making it difficult to interpret the distribution of mpg.

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = hp, color = factor(cyl), shape = factor(gear))) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  labs(title = "Proper Separability",
       x = "Miles per Gallon (mpg)",
       y = "Horsepower (hp)",
       color = "Cylinders",
       shape = "Gears")

```

**Caption**: Figure 5 uses separate color and shape channels to encode the number of cylinders and gears, maintaining separability.

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = hp, fill = factor(cyl), alpha = hp)) +
  geom_point(size = 5, shape = 21) +
  labs(title = "Violation of Separability",
       x = "Miles per Gallon (mpg)",
       y = "Horsepower (hp)",
       fill = "Cylinders",
       alpha = "Horsepower")

```

**Caption**: Figure 6 uses fill color and transparency, which are less separable, to encode the number of cylinders and horsepower, violating the principle of separability.

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = hp)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, color = "grey") +
  geom_point(data = subset(mtcars, cyl == 4), aes(x = mpg, y = hp), color = "red", size = 4) +
  labs(title = "Effective Popout",
       x = "Miles per Gallon (mpg)",
       y = "Horsepower (hp)")

```

**Caption**: Figure 7 highlights cars with 4 cylinders in red, effectively using the concept of popout.

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = hp, color = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  labs(title = "Ineffective Popout",
       x = "Miles per Gallon (mpg)",
       y = "Horsepower (hp)",
       color = "Cylinders")

```

**Caption**: Figure 8 uses color to distinguish all cylinder counts, making it difficult to identify specific points and failing to achieve the popout effect compared to Figure 7.
