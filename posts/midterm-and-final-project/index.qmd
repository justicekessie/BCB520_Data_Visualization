### Description of Data

Lassa virus (LASV) is endemic to West Africa, where it is responsible for causing a potentially severe hemorrhagic fever in humans. The primary reservoir of LASV is the rodent *Mastomys natalensis*, with transmission to humans occurring through contact with the animalâ€™s contaminated urine, feces, blood, or tissue. According to estimates from the World Health Organization (WHO), LASV is responsible for approximately 300,000 cases of illness and 5,000 deaths annually across West Africa. In Nigeria, a significant outbreak in 2022 resulted in 1,067 confirmed cases and 189 fatalities, yielding a case fatality rate (CFR) of 17.7%. By March 2023, there were 784 confirmed cases and 142 deaths in the country. Furthermore, the virus has spread westward, notably into Ghana, where a recent outbreak led to 14 confirmed cases, 97 traced contacts, and one death. Lassa fever continues to be a major public health concern, particularly in impoverished communities in West Africa. Its persistent spread westward underscores the critical need for intensified research efforts and the implementation of effective control measures.

Given the absence of a human vaccine for LASV, current interventions focus on reducing contact between humans and infected animals, either through behavioral changes or through the mass culling of the rodent reservoir. An alternative and promising approach involves the use of transmissible vaccines to rapidly establish immunity within wild animal reservoir populations, thereby reducing the prevalence of the virus. The key advantage of transmissible vaccines lies in their potential to limit the occurrence of spillover events from rodent reservoirs to human populations while conserving ecological biodiversity. The proposed research seeks to address the urgent need for effective control strategies against LASV in West Africa by evaluating the potential impact of a transmissible vaccine. A prototype transmissible vaccine for LASV has been developed, and the next crucial step involves predicting its efficacy in reducing viral spillover into human populations, particularly in regions such as Western Nigeria and Ghana, where the virus is expanding its range. This objective will be accomplished through the pursuit of the following aims:

1.  Developing and parameterize a within-host models for vaccine replication, immune response, and evolutionary dynamics.

Our collaborators in the University of Western Australia run the murine model of Lassa virus infection. The data from this model is used for this study. The following is the mathematical model used for this study
